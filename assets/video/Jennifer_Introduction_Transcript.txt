Hi, I’m Jennifer. I’m a full-stack developer focused on building accessible, intuitive products—where empathy meets engineering.

I create web experiences that are efficient, effective, and enjoyable for all users. My work blends front-end and back-end development, usability testing, and thoughtful design systems.

Accessibility is central to everything I do. Whether I’m beginning a project with accessibility as a primary requirement, or updating an existing site to meet regulations without sacrificing brand identity, my goal is always the same: to enhance usability for everyone.

It’s not just about compliance; it’s about creating experiences that are genuinely user-friendly and engaging.

At BirthdayMessaging, I led an accessibility redesign that improved both the app and the website. I focused on clear semantic structure, reusable React and Tailwind components, and full keyboard navigation. The result was a fully WCAG-compliant interface that improved the experience for all users, including individuals with disabilities, and demonstrated how thoughtful code can meaningfully support people using assistive technologies.

This work continues to guide how I design, build, and evaluate products.

I have experience working in remote and diverse teams, which connects to my multicultural background. I live in Germany with my family and speak English, German, and French.

Living abroad has helped me understand the importance of inclusion, curiosity, and empathy—skills that directly influence how I design for diverse users.

I’m excited about opportunities that prioritize accessibility and product quality.
Let’s connect to explore how my approach can help your team create more inclusive experiences.

Thank you for your time. It was great meeting you.
